# Portfoliator

Official hack for the Hack Your Portfolio MLH Hackathon by Team Cheesy! ðŸ§€

### Inspiration

There are (currently) 7.8 billion people on Earth, and if you wanted to look through all of their portfolios for some reason, it would be a great deal of work. When it came to showcasing our portfolio, we wanted to give you guys a passâ€“we wanted to build something that could automatically walk through our portfolio with no user input at all (except a press of a buttonâ€“but that's inconsequential).

### What it does

The Portfoliator is a hardware hack that uses a Raspberry Pi 4 to emulate a keyboard. All you do is connect the pi to your computer, and press the attached button. With that, you are presented with a live demo of who we are, what we've built, and a quick walkthrough of the top projects we've built together (music included).
